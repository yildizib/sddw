Platform-independent Spec-Driven Development Workflow with adapters for
[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and OpenCode.

- Write **requirements**, optionally **analyse the codebase**, then **design** architecture, then **taskify** (as hybrid task files referencing `design.md`), then **implement** each task separately, then **verify** the result, then **self-improve** the workflow
- The agent guides you through every step — researches, proposes options, confirms your decisions
- Every step produces exactly one spec type. Every step reads specs from previous steps.
- `/clear` context between steps — each step works within a focused context window
- Two interaction modes: guided dialog (default) or fully `--auto`
- Lightweight and easily customizable — just markdown files, no runtime dependencies

The workflow core is isolated from platform integrations. Claude and OpenCode
adapters provide only command syntax, tool mappings, and installation. A new
platform can be added under `adapters/` without changing the core workflow.

## Why

The standard way to use AI coding agents is short, interactive prompts: describe what you want, get code, fix it, repeat. This works for small tasks but breaks down for anything non-trivial — context gets lost between sessions, architectural decisions live only in chat history, and there's no artifact a teammate can review before code is written.

`sddw` inverts this. Instead of prompting for code, you collaborate with the agent to write **specifications** — requirements, architecture, interface contracts, task breakdowns. The specs become the primary artifact: reviewable by peers, version-controlled, persistent across sessions. Code generation is then a mechanical step guided by approved specs, not a creative leap from a vague prompt.

Detailed specifications reduce AI code errors by up to 50% (Piskala, 2026), security defects by 73% (Marri, 2026), and architecture-misaligned PRs by 60% (GitHub Spec Kit). `sddw` is designed for medium to large projects that don't fit into a single context window. By splitting work into discrete steps — requirements, codebase analysis, design, per-task implementation — each step operates within a focused context where models are more accurate, rather than a sprawling conversation where critical details get lost.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sermakarevich/sddw.git ~/.claude/sddw
cd ~/.claude/sddw && bash bin/install.sh
```

### OpenCode

Install the OpenCode adapter globally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sermakarevich/sddw.git ~/.config/opencode/sddw
cd ~/.config/opencode/sddw && bash adapters/opencode/install.sh
```

For local development, install the shared core and commands from a checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sermakarevich/sddw.git
cd sddw && bash adapters/opencode/install.sh --local
```

To install OpenCode command wrappers into a specific project:

```bash
bash adapters/opencode/install.sh --local --project /path/to/project
```

For development (symlink from local repo):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sermakarevich/sddw.git
cd sddw && bash bin/install.sh --local
```

## Interaction Modes

Every step supports two interaction modes:

| Mode | Flag | Behavior |
|------|------|----------|
| **Interactive** | *(default)* | Full guided dialog — one question at a time, every section confirmed |
| **Auto** | `--auto` | Fully autonomous — no questions, best-judgment decisions |

Claude Code uses the `/sddw:<step>` command format. OpenCode uses the
equivalent `/sddw-<step>` command format. Both adapters use the same core
workflow instructions, questionnaires, specifications, and `.sddw/` artifact
layout.

## Usage

**Vibecoding** — `--auto`. The agent decides everything.

**Agentic engineering** — default mode. You stay in control: review proposals, add missing context, ask questions, approve each spec section before it's written, and validate the output spec.

## Steps

1. **Requirements** — collaboratively produce a feature spec with user stories, FRs, and acceptance criteria
2. **Code Analysis** *(optional)* — scan existing codebase for patterns, interfaces, and conventions
3. **Design** — produce a cross-cutting `design.md` with architecture, models, and decisions
4. **Taskify** — break the feature into hybrid task files referencing `design.md`
5. **Implement** — execute one task at a time following TDD and commit protocols
6. **Verify** — validate the implementation against requirements and acceptance criteria
7. **Self-Improve** — analyse execution across all steps and propose workflow improvements
- **Design & Taskify** — combined alias: run design and taskify in one shot (`/sddw:design_and_taskify`)
- **Chat** — fast-track interaction with an existing feature: questions, edits, quick fixes
- **Help** — workflow overview, list features, check feature status

### 1. Requirements

```
/sddw:requirements <feature-name> [--auto]
```

Collaboratively produce a requirements spec through guided dialog:

- **Discover** — understand the feature through one-at-a-time questions
- **Research & Propose** — research SOTA, codebase, domain; propose each section with ranked options
- **Confirm & Generate** — user approves each block, spec is written

Output: `.sddw/<feature-name>/requirements.md`
Sections: Purpose, User Stories, Functional Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, Constraints

### 2. Code Analysis (optional)

```
/sddw:code-analysis <feature-name> [--auto]
```

Analyse the existing codebase to ground design decisions in reality:

- **Discover** — understand which areas of the codebase matter most
- **Research & Propose** — scan for patterns, interfaces, flows, conventions
- **Confirm & Generate** — user approves each section, analysis is written

Output: `.sddw/code-analysis.md` (shared across features)
Sections: Relevant Patterns, Key Interfaces, Existing Flows, Conventions

Skip this step for greenfield projects with no existing codebase.

### 3. Design

```
/sddw:design <feature-name> [--auto]
```

Produce a cross-cutting `design.md` through guided dialog:

- **Discover** — understand architectural preferences and constraints
- **Research & Propose** — propose architecture, data models, contracts, and decisions
- **Confirm & Generate** — user approves each block, `design.md` is written

Output: `.sddw/<feature-name>/design/design.md`

### 4. Taskify

```
/sddw:taskify <feature-name> [--auto]
```

Break the feature into hybrid task files based on requirements and design:

- **Discover** — understand task granularity preferences
- **Research & Propose** — propose task breakdown in dependency order
- **Confirm & Generate** — user approves task list, task files are written

Output:

```
.sddw/<feature-name>/
└── design/
    ├── design.md
    └── tasks/
        ├── task-1-<slug>.md  # hybrid: files, criteria, references design.md
        ├── task-2-<slug>.md
        └── ...
```

Each task file includes task-specific details inline and references `design.md` for architecture, models, and shared contracts, so the implementation agent has full context without duplication.

### Design & Taskify (Combined Alias)

```
/sddw:design_and_taskify <feature-name> [--auto]
```

Runs the design and taskify steps in one shot. Use this for small features where iterating on architecture independently is not needed.

### 5. Implement

```
/sddw:implement <feature-name> --task <N> [--auto]
```

Execute a single task from the design spec:

- **Discover** — select task, check dependencies, gather context
- **Research & Propose** — scan codebase, propose implementation approach and TDD applicability
- **Execute** — implement following TDD protocol, commit protocol, and deviation handling

Each task file is a hybrid — the agent loads it alongside `design.md` so it has full context.

After each task, a completion report (`task-N-<slug>.done.md`) is written to `implement/tasks/`, documenting what was done, deviations, and difficulties.

### 6. Verify

```
/sddw:verify <feature-name> [--auto]
```

Verify the implementation against requirements after all tasks are complete:

- **Assess** — load artifacts, detect test runner, check task completion status
- **Verify** — run test suite, cross-check each FR's acceptance criteria, review done criteria
- **Report & Remediate** — produce verification report, create remediation tasks if issues found

Output:

```
.sddw/<feature-name>/
└── verify/
    └── report.md    # FR-by-FR pass/fail, test results, deviations, warnings
```

If issues are found, remediation tasks are created as additional task files in `design/tasks/` (continuing the numbering). These can be executed with `/sddw:implement` and then verified again — the loop repeats until all checks pass.

### 7. Self-Improve

```
/sddw:self-improve <feature-name> [--auto]
```

Analyse the completed feature's execution across all workflow steps. Identify what went wrong (or could be better) and propose concrete improvements to the workflow itself:

- **Analyse** — extract signals: deviations, difficulties, remediation task origins, spec gaps
- **Diagnose** — classify findings by workflow step, identify patterns, propose improvements
- **Apply** — present proposals with diff previews, apply approved changes to workflow files

Output:

```
.sddw/<feature-name>/
└── self-improve/
    └── report.md    # findings, proposals, applied/skipped changes
```

Each improvement targets a specific workflow component (instruction, questionnaire, or spec) with a concrete diff. The workflow evolves with every feature — gaps found during one feature prevent the same issues in the next.

### Chat

```
/sddw:chat <feature-name> [--auto]
```

Fast-track interaction with a feature that already has artifacts. Skips the full questionnaire ceremony — just load context and talk.

- **Questions** — ask anything about the feature; answered from loaded artifacts and codebase
- **Spec updates** — edit requirements, FRs, acceptance criteria, or task files in-place
- **Quick implementation** — small code changes following TDD and commit protocols
- **Status** — check feature progress

Chat assumes you know what you want and only pauses for scope-affecting changes or ambiguous requests.

If a request is too large (new task files, new architecture, >3 files), chat redirects you to the full workflow.

### Help

```
/sddw:help [list | status <feature-name>]
```

- `/sddw:help` — workflow overview and available commands
- `/sddw:help list` — list all features with progress indicators
- `/sddw:help status <feature-name>` — detailed feature status: which steps are done, task progress, completion reports

## Anatomy of a Step

Each step is assembled from four modular components:

| Component | Purpose | Folder |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Command** | Thin platform entry point with frontmatter and core references | `adapters/<platform>/commands/` |
| **Claude adapter** | Claude command wrappers, bridge, and installer | `adapters/claude/` |
| **OpenCode adapter** | OpenCode command wrappers, bridge, and installer | `adapters/opencode/` |
| **Instructions** | Process rules — what to do, in what order | `core/instructions/` |
| **Questionnaire** | Platform-neutral dialog guidance | `core/questionnaires/` |
| **Specs** | Output format templates — what to produce | `core/specs/` |

A command wires these together:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ adapters/<platform>/commands/<step>.md                    │
│                                                          │
│  core/instructions/<step>.md    ← process rules           │
│  core/questionnaires/<step>.md  ← dialog flow             │
│  core/specs/<step>.md           ← output format           │
│                                                          │
│  reads:  .sddw/<feature>/<previous_step>.md  ← input     │
│  writes: .sddw/<feature>/<current_step>.md   ← output    │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each component lives in its own folder so they can be reused, tested, and evolved independently. The command file itself stays small — just references and glue.

Every step follows a three-phase dialog: **Discover → Research & Propose → Confirm & Generate**. One question at a time, structured options, every spec block confirmed by the user before generation.
