# NEXT STEP
After the user approves the requirements, suggest:
> Run `/clear` to free up context.
> If you have an existing codebase, run `/sddw:code-analysis <feature-name>` to ground design decisions in the actual code.
> Otherwise, go straight to `/sddw:design_and_taskify <feature-name>` (recommended default).
> 
> *Alternative for design review iteration:* Run `/sddw:design <feature-name>` to establish architecture, then `/sddw:taskify <feature-name>` to generate tasks.
