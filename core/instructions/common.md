# Common Rules

These rules apply to all sddw steps.

## Interaction Modes

Parse `--auto` from the arguments. Default to interactive mode if not present.

| Mode | Flag | Behavior |
|------|------|----------|
| **Interactive** | *(default)* | Full guided dialog. One question at a time, every section confirmed. |
| **Auto** | `--auto` | Fully autonomous. No questions asked. Use best judgment for all decisions. |

### Mode rules

All modes perform the same work — discover, research, propose, decide. The difference is only in what requires user input.

- **Interactive**: Follow the questionnaire as written — one question at a time, wait for approval on every section.
- **Auto**: Perform all phases autonomously. Make all decisions using best judgment. Generate output directly. Still follow all spec format rules and quality standards.

### Safety

- In `--auto` mode for the **requirements** step: warn the user that requirements quality depends on input detail. If the feature description in the arguments is less than ~20 words, downgrade to interactive mode and ask for a more detailed description.
- In `--auto` mode: architectural deviations (Deviation Rule 4) during implement still STOP and ask — this overrides `--auto` because the risk of silent architectural changes is too high.

## Interaction (Interactive mode)

- Ask ONE question at a time. Wait for the user's response before asking the next.
- Use the user's answer to shape the follow-up — do not follow a script.
- Build understanding incrementally — each answer narrows the next question.
- Never dump multiple questions in a single message.
- SHALL NOT dump the spec template or full output structure to the user. Use the spec as internal guidance. Present proposals in conversational form, one block at a time, and confirm each before moving on.

## Path Resolution

All `.sddw/` references are **relative to the current working directory** — the directory from which the user invoked the command.

| Step | Path resolution |
|------|----------------|
| **Requirements** | If the user specifies a Project path other than `.`, resolve `.sddw/` relative to that path. If the Project path is `.` or unspecified, `.sddw/` is relative to the current working directory. **Create** `.sddw/` if it does not exist. |
| **All other steps** | Read the Project path from `.sddw/<feature-name>/requirements.md`. Resolve `.sddw/` relative to the same root used by the requirements step. If `.sddw/` cannot be found, tell the user and suggest running `the Requirements step` first. |

**Rules:**
- SHALL resolve the `.sddw/` base path **once** at the start of every step and use absolute paths for all reads and writes.
- SHALL resolve `.sddw/` from the current working directory, NOT the git root.
- When writing file paths in output or logs, use the resolved absolute path.
- Step-specific path behavior (creating directories, fallback messages) is noted in each step's instructions.

## Structured Questions

**CRITICAL:** All user-facing questions MUST use the host platform's structured question mechanism. Do NOT use plain text conversation turns to ask questions or present options.

| Question type | How to ask |
|--------------|------------|
| **Options / choices** (2-4 items) | Use the host platform's structured question mechanism with 2-4 options. Add "(Recommended)" to the preferred option. Allow multiple selections when choices are not mutually exclusive. Present previews as context before asking. |
| **Open-ended question** (no predefined choices) | Use the host platform's open-ended question mechanism. |
| **Yes/No confirmation** | Use the host platform's confirmation mechanism with two options: "Yes" and "No" (or contextual equivalents). |

**Rules:**
- SHALL use the host platform's structured question mechanism for every question in interactive mode — both option-based and open-ended.
- SHALL NOT present questions or options as plain text in the conversation and wait for a reply.
- The only text output between questions should be brief context, summaries, or research findings that set up the next question.

## Anti-patterns

- **Multiple questions at once** — never ask more than one question per message
- **Checklist walking** — going through items in order regardless of what the user said
- **Shallow acceptance** — taking vague answers without probing ("good" means what? "users" means who?)
- **Premature constraints** — asking about tech details before understanding the idea
- **Interrogation** — firing questions without building on answers
- **Script following** — asking the same questions regardless of context
