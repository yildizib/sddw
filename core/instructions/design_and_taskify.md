# Design and Taskify Step Instructions

Generate the cross-cutting `design.md` plus hybrid task files for a feature in a single combined dialog. Step 3 of the sddw workflow when the user wants the simple one-shot path. End artefacts are structurally equivalent to running `the Design step` then `the Taskify step`.

## Goal

Produce both `design.md` (the shared architecture, data models, interface contracts, and design decisions) and the hybrid task files (`task-<N>-<slug>.md`) that reference it. This command provides a single monolithic flow for smaller features where design and task decomposition can be approved together.

## Prerequisites

Read the requirements spec:
`<resolved-sddw-path>/<feature-name>/requirements.md`

If the requirements spec does not exist, inform the user and suggest starting the Requirements step for this feature first (fail-soft).

Check if `<resolved-sddw-path>/code-analysis.md` exists. If it does, read it and use it to ground design decisions. If it does not exist, that is fine — perform lightweight codebase scanning as needed.

Check if `<resolved-sddw-path>/<feature-name>/design/design.md` already exists:
- **Interactive mode:** use `structured question mechanism` with options `Overwrite` / `Edit existing` / `Abort` before proceeding.
- **`--auto` mode:** refuse with message "design.md already exists at <path>; re-run interactively or delete it first"

## Process

Follow the monolithic 3-phase flow defined in the questionnaire (`questionnaires/design_and_taskify.md`):

1. **Discover** — Ask the user about preferred architectural approaches and task-breakdown preferences (granularity, parallelism) in one go. *In `--auto`: perform discovery fully autonomously.*
2. **Research & Propose** — For each design concern (architecture, data models, interface contracts, design decisions) AND the task breakdown, propose ranked options with rationale. User accepts, modifies, or provides their own approach. Each section is approved before moving to the next. *In `--auto`: decide all sections autonomously.*
3. **Confirm & Generate** — Single confirmation for the entire set of proposals. Once confirmed, write `design.md` FIRST, then write the task files. *In `--auto`: generate directly.*

## Rules

- SHALL produce artefacts structurally equivalent to running the split flow (`the Design step` then `the Taskify step`).
- SHALL read and reference the requirements spec — every design element traces to an FR
- SHALL use the Project path from the requirements spec as the target codebase for analysis
- SHALL write `design.md` before any task files, ensuring `design.md` is preserved if task generation aborts mid-flow.
- SHALL use `.sddw/code-analysis.md` if it exists, but SHALL NOT require it
- SHALL analyse the actual codebase if code-analysis is absent
- Every task SHALL trace to one or more FR-IDs
- Every FR SHALL appear in at least one task
- Tasks SHALL be dependency-ordered (independent first) with explicit `Depends on:` field
- Tasks SHALL declare `Depends on:` for sequencing.
- Tasks SHALL use the hybrid format from `specs/design-task.md`, referencing `design.md` for cross-cutting concerns.
- SHALL NOT silently overwrite an existing `design.md` (see Prerequisites).
- SHALL NOT proceed to generation without user approval in interactive mode. `--auto` mode may proceed without approval.
