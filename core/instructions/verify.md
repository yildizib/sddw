# Verify Step Instructions

Verify the implementation against requirements, run tests, and create remediation tasks if issues are found. This is the final step of the sddw workflow.

## Goal

Confirm that all functional requirements are implemented correctly, tests pass, and acceptance criteria are satisfied. If issues are found, produce remediation task files that can be executed with `the Implement step`.

## Prerequisites

Read the feature artifacts from `<resolved-sddw-path>/<feature-name>/`:

| Artifact | Path | Required |
|----------|------|----------|
| Requirements | `<feature-name>/requirements.md` | Yes |
| Design | `<feature-name>/design/design.md` | Yes |
| Task files | `<feature-name>/design/tasks/task-*.md` | Yes |
| Completion reports | `<feature-name>/implement/tasks/*.done.md` | Yes |
| Code analysis | `code-analysis.md` | No |

If requirements or task files do not exist, stop and suggest running the missing step first.
If `design.md` is missing, stop and inform the user they must regenerate the feature tasks by running `the Design step` then `the Taskify step`.

If no completion reports exist, warn the user that no tasks appear to have been implemented and suggest running `the Implement step` first.

Use the Project path from `<resolved-sddw-path>/<feature-name>/requirements.md` as the working directory.

## Process

Follow the three-phase flow defined in the questionnaire:

1. **Assess** — Load all artifacts, identify the test runner, check which tasks are complete vs pending. *In `--auto`: assess fully autonomously.*

2. **Verify** — Run the test suite, cross-check each FR's acceptance criteria against implementation, review done criteria from task files, and check for deviations noted in completion reports. Classify each FR as pass, fail, or partial. *In `--auto`: classify all autonomously.*

3. **Report & Remediate** — Produce a verification report. If any FRs failed or are partial, propose remediation tasks. User confirms which remediation tasks to create. *In `--auto`: create all proposed remediation tasks directly.*

## Verification Checks

For each functional requirement (FR) in the requirements spec:

### 1. Test Execution
- Detect the test runner from the codebase (look for test config files, package.json scripts, pytest.ini, pyproject.toml, Makefile test targets, etc.)
- Run the full test suite
- Record pass/fail counts, failing test names, and error messages

### 2. Acceptance Criteria Coverage
For each FR's acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then scenarios from requirements.md):
- Check if a corresponding test exists that covers the scenario
- If the scenario has no test, flag as uncovered
- If a test exists but fails, flag as failing

### 3. Done Criteria Check
For each completed task's done criteria:
- Verify each criterion is satisfied (file exists, function works, constraint met)
- Cross-reference with the completion report

### 4. Deviation Review
From completion reports (.done.md files):
- Check if any noted deviations have unresolved consequences
- Check if spec gaps noted during implementation were addressed

## Issue Classification

| Severity | Condition | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Fail** | Test failure, missing required functionality, acceptance criterion violated | Create remediation task |
| **Partial** | Acceptance criterion uncovered by tests, done criterion partially met | Create remediation task |
| **Warning** | Unresolved deviation, minor gap, missing edge case | Note in report, user decides |
| **Pass** | All criteria met, tests pass | No action needed |

## Remediation Tasks

When issues are found, create remediation task files in the same location as design tasks:

`.sddw/<feature-name>/design/tasks/task-<N>-fix-<slug>.md`

Where `<N>` continues the numbering from existing tasks. Follow the same task file format from the design-task spec.

**Rules for remediation tasks:**
- SHALL follow the exact same hybrid format as design task files
- SHALL reference `design.md` for cross-cutting context
- SHALL reference the FR-IDs that need fixing
- SHALL include the specific failing tests or uncovered criteria in the acceptance criteria section
- `Depends on:` SHALL reference the original task that implemented the failing functionality
- SHALL be scoped to fix the specific issue — no scope creep
- SHALL be implementable through the platform's Implement command with the feature name and task number.
- SHALL classify the root cause origin in the verification report: `requirements` (ambiguous/missing spec), `design` (task scoping/architecture gap), `implementation` (code bug), or `external` (dependency/environment issue)

---

## Rules

- SHALL run actual tests, not assume results
- SHALL classify every FR explicitly as PASS, FAIL, or PARTIAL
- SHALL reference specific test names and error messages for failures
- SHALL overwrite the previous verification report when re-run (idempotent)
- SHALL NOT modify existing task files or completion reports
- SHALL NOT create remediation tasks without user approval (interactive mode). `--auto` mode may create them directly.
- SHALL NOT proceed to report generation without completing all verification checks
